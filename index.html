            <h3>Here's a time line of Fela Aníkúlápó Kuti's life:</h3>
            <div class="timeline">
              <ul>
                <li><span>1938</span> - Born 15 October in Nigeria</li>
                <li>
                  <span>1958</span> - He attended the Abeokuta Grammar School in
                  Abeokuta and later he was sent to London in 1958 to study
                  medicine but decided to study music instead at the Trinity
                  College of Music, the trumpet being his preferred instrument.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1960</span> - Fela married his first wife, Remilekun
                  (Remi) Taylor, with whom he would have three children (Femi,
                  Yeni, and Sola)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1963</span> - He moved back to Nigeria, re-formed Koola
                  Lobitos and trained as a radio producer for the Nigerian
                  Broadcasting Corporation. He played for some time with Victor
                  Olaiya and his All Stars
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1967</span> - He went to Ghana to think up a new musical
                  direction.That was when Kuti first called his music Afrobeat.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1969</span> - Fela took the band to the United States
                  where they spent 10 months in Los Angeles. While there, Fela
                  discovered the Black Power movement through Sandra Smith (now
                  Sandra Izsadore), a partisan of the Black Panther Party. The
                  experience would heavily influence his music and political
                  views..
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1978</span> - After Fela and his band returned to
                  Nigeria, the group was renamed The Afrika '70, as lyrical
                  themes changed from love to social issues.He then formed the
                  Kalakuta Republic, a commune, a recording studio, and a home
                  for the many people connected to the band that he later
                  declared independent from the Nigerian state
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1972</span>- Ginger Baker recorded Stratavarious with
                  Fela appearing alongside Bobby Tench.Around this time, Kuti
                  became even more involved in the Yoruba religion.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1977</span>- He and the Afrika '70 released the album
                  Zombie, a scathing attack on Nigerian soldiers using the
                  zombie metaphor to describe the methods of the Nigerian
                  military. The album was a smash hit and infuriated the
                  government, setting off a vicious attack against the Kalakuta
                  Republic, during which one thousand soldiers attacked the
                  commune. Fela was severely beaten, and his elderly mother
                  (whose house was located opposite the commune) was thrown from
                  a window, causing fatal injuries.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1978</span>- Fela married 27 women, many of whom were
                  his dancers, composers, and singers to mark the anniversary of
                  the attack on the Kalakuta Republic. Later, he was to adopt a
                  rotation system of keeping only 12 simultaneous wives.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>1979</span>- He put himself forward for President in
                  Nigeria's first elections for more than a decade, but his
                  candidature was refused. At this time, Fela created a new band
                  called Egypt '80 (reflecting his reading of pan-African
                  literature) and continued to record albums and tour the
                  country. He further infuriated the political establishment by
                  dropping the names of ITT Corporation vice-president Moshood
                  Abiola and then General Olusegun Obasanjo at the end of a
                  hot-selling 25-minute political screed entitled "I.T.T.
                  (International Thief-Thief)".
